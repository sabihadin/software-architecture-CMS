# Technology

## Context and Problem Statement

Before the CMS is developed, the technology needs to be decided and will be used in the proof-of-concept application.

## Considered Options

-	HTML/CSS/JS
-	Blazor 
-	React

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: “HTML/CSS/JS”, because it is a simple and effective way to make an interactive proof of concept application. It allows the core functionalities of the CMS to be demonstrated whilst also fitting well with the chosen layered architecture. It is also practical, allowing the POC to be easily maintaned and expanded.

### Consequences

-	Good, because it supports dynamic content, integrates efficiently with databases, easily scaled and maintained, consistent and flexible
-	Bad, because may not be as good as more modern frameworks, may have slower initial load times
